My new book is out! It is was an amazing journey we, the authors, took in writing the first ever Metal book for game engine developers. If you were wondering why there was no blog post for almost half a year now, this was the reason :)

Use this link [https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/metal-by-tutorials](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/metal-by-tutorials) if you want to purchase the book. For only a limited time the price is discounted.

I want to thank my co-author, [Caroline Begbie](https://twitter.com/carolinebegbie), and the publisher, [Ray Wenderlich](http://raywenderlich.com), for helping me make this book a reality. 
 
Until next time!
